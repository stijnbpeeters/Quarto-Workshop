This is the Amazing World of Woodland Creatures. <!-- Start by making this the title of this document -->

<!-- Start this section with a level 2 header titled "Woodland Animals.-->

In the woodlands, many animals exhibit unique habits and characteristics. Let's explore some of these fascinating creatures. 

One of the most clever creatures is the fox <!-- write fox in bold -->. Foxes are known for their intelligence and adaptability. To illustrate this, here's a sample code snippet that describes the fox's traits. 

<!-- Display both by code and the result in your output.

fox_traits <- c("clever", "quick", "cunning") 
print(fox_traits) 

-->


Another familiar face in the woodland is the hedgehog. <!-- This section should start with a level 3 header named "The Hedgehog" --> Hedgehogs <!-- write 'Hedgehogs' in Italic --> are famous for curling into a spiky ball when threatened. 

<!-- Use a code chunk to print a message that says, "The hedgehog curls up!" Show only the result, not the code. -->

Now let's discuss Squirrels, energetic creatures that are constantly on the move. <!-- Add a level 4 header titled "Squirrels in Action." -->

Squirrels <!-- Underline `Squirrels` --> in  spend hours each day gathering food. 

<!--Here's a code snippet that calculates the number of acorns a squirrel gathers in a day, assuming it gathers 5 acorns per hour for 8 hours. Hide the code but display only the total acorns gathered.

acorns_per_hour <- 5 
total_acorns <- acorns_per_hour * 8 total_acorns
